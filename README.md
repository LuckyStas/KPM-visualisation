# KPM-visualisation
Knuth–Morris–Pratt string-searching algorithm searches for occurrences of a "word" W within a main "text string" S by employing the observation that when a mismatch occurs, \
the word itself embodies sufficient information to determine where the next match could begin, thus bypassing re-examination of previously matched characters.

And here is my visualisation of it:\
